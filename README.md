HomeTaskManager is a convenient tool for household related purposes. It allows you to perform a variety of tasks, from keeping track of chores, displaying photo galleries on digital picture frames, to sharing links and files quickly and conveniently with members of your household.

It requires minimal setup and configuration, with a high degree of customisation.



Requirements
 - A server of some kind. I built this with RasberryPi in mind, so please be aware that there might be bugs or security issues if it runs on a server outside of your local network.

Setup and Configuration

make init
